### `Description`

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. Youâ€™ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

### `Functionality`

This project will serve as the back-end portion of my WTWR application. An API is created, the URL routes are configured, and a database is created and configured using MongoDB.

### `Technologies and Techniques`

Controllers were created to serve as the destination for my collection of request handler functions. Models were used to store my schemas. Lastly, routes were created to handle sending webpages and receiving data from the user. Through compartmentalizing, I was able to structure my code in such a way that allowed for seamless debugging. MongoDB provided a database, whilst Express.js allowed for the creation and modification of the data that would be sent and received from the database.
